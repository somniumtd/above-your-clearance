# Above Your Clearance

"Above Your Clearance" is a short humorous "choose your own path" style adventure game, in which you try to complete an important mission, without dying or running out of money in the attempt. It was made as part of the #1GAM (One Game a Month) challenge, as my May 2017 entry.

## Plot and gameplay

In the game, you play as a Citizen in an oppressive society, who has "volunteered" to perform a dangerous mission for the paranoid Artificial Intelligence which rules the society. You have to navigate through a series of situations, where you have to decide what to do. Choose wisely - lose too many credits or clones (extra "lives") during the mission, and you will fail.

The game is structured as a sequence of situations, each with a set of choices to choose between. It is loosely based on the tabletop RPG system called Paranoia, and I've tried to transfer the dark humor present in that setting into text game form.
